The rights granted under the Apache License 2.0 are extended to all users,
subject to the following additional condition:

1. You may use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and create
   derivative works of the Software for any purpose, including private,
   educational, or internal commercial use within your own organization.

   - Providing services or products that use the Software as a tool (but do not
     include its source code or compiled binaries) is allowed.
   - Redistributing or bundling the Software or its derivatives in a product
     that is sold or licensed for a fee is not allowed.

3. Any notice or attribution required by the Apache License must also include
   this "No Selling" Clause and the "Source-Available" notice above.
